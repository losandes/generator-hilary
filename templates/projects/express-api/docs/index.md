# Introduction

This API is a REST API. It is built on HTTP standards, with intuitive URIs, leveraging HTTP response codes and HTTP verbs that can be consumed by off-the-shelf HTTP clients. It uses cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) to support secure interactions between your client and our resources. All responses are in JSON format, including payloads associated with errors.

#### **Example Info**: We convert h4 elements `####` to info alerts. If you don't like that, set `docs.useHeadingAlerts` to `false` in your `environment.json` file.

##### **Example Warning**: We convert h5 elements `#####` to danger alerts. If you don't like that, set `docs.useHeadingAlerts` to `false` in your `environment.json` file.
