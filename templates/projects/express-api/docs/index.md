# Introduction

This API is a REST API. It is built on HTTP standards, with intuitive URIs, leveraging HTTP response codes and HTTP verbs that can be consumed by off-the-shelf HTTP clients. It uses cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) to support secure interactions between your client and our resources. All reponses are in JSON format, including payloads associated with errors.
